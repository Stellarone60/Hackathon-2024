Theme: "Practical solutions"

The problem we are trying to solve is motivation to complete a project. Often, large projects are overwhelming and feel very daunting to start. We are designing a simple planner that will keep track of the projects the user has. The user will be asked to split their project into smaller tasks that will help them approach their project without feeling overwhelmed. Once done with the saller tasks, the user will be able to mark them off and some kind of "reward" will appear

We claimed a domain name for this project. The domain name is myhandyplanner.courses.



Some features that we would have implemented if we had more time would be integrating a database that would store the unique lists for each user. We also wanted to create sublists and extra lists, which would have helped a lot with the overall goal of the project.
